# Todo: Question: Implement a To-Do List
#   Create a simple command-line to-do list program in Python. Your program should allow users to perform the following
#   operations:
#       1. Add a task: Users should be able to add tasks to their to-do list.
#       2. View tasks: Users should be able to view their current to-do list.
#       3. Mark a task as done: Users should be able to mark tasks as done or completed.
#       4. Delete a task: Users should be able to delete tasks from their to-do list.
#   You should implement these operations using functions and a list to store the tasks.
#   Here's a sample interaction with the program:

"""
To-Do List Program
-------------------

1. Add a task
2. View tasks
3. Mark a task as done
4. Delete a task
5. Quit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter the task: Buy groceries
Task added successfully!

Enter your choice: 1
Enter the task: Clean the house
Task added successfully!

Enter your choice: 2
To-Do List:
1. Buy groceries
2. Clean the house

Enter your choice: 3
Enter the task number to mark as done: 1
Task 'Buy groceries' marked as done!

Enter your choice: 4
Enter the task number to delete: 2
Task 'Clean the house' deleted!

Enter your choice: 2
To-Do List:
1. Buy groceries

Enter your choice: 5
Goodbye!
